- How Good ？
  - 系统理解名词限定的问题，
  - 而不是陷入背语法书然而无法理解和运用的挫败死循环



## 单数还是复数？

Other **businesses** that grubbed in the **ashes** to make the dull **necessities** of life-**auto parts, lawn furniture**-were now of **interest** mostly for how much **technology** they could buy.

[^grub]: to look for sth. especially by digging or by looking through or under other things.
[^dull]: ①not intersting or exciting. ②not busy, slow
[^ lawn]:  a type of fine cotton or linen cloth used for making clothes. 上等细棉布
[^necessity]: a thing that you must have and canot manage without.

- 语法书要读，但仅仅读语法书还不够，还需要理解

- 任何名词，即有可能作为复数，也有可能是单数
- 名词的单复数由词义和语境所决定的。

eg:

> - 1. **The news** are bad.
>
>   - wrong : the news is bad
>
> - 2a. **Economics** is often called "the dismal science".
>
>   - right: 集合名词
>
> - 2b. The economics of the project **make** it impossible to proceed.
>
>   - right: 具体情境下的具体的收支情况
>
> - 3a. One was if interest rate fell and remained below **historic level.**
>
>   - right: 具体的条数
>
> - 3b. Pentagon spending to reach **historic levels**
>
>   - right：通常用复数
>
> - 4a. The government **have** decided to raise taxes.
>
>   - [x] right:  相对机构内部多职能部门
>
> - 4b. The government **has** decided..
>
>   - [x] right: 相对于实体
>
> - 4c. **Barclays** have reported..
>
>   - Barclays 公司名称的英式和美式用法不同：

>   - 美式英语：单数，一个整体
>
> - 6a. A number of options is available.
>
>   - right: 一个实体
>
> - 6b. There were a number of apples on the table.
>
> - 7. none of the seats was in the right place.
>      - 一个属类

## 名词的合法身份

> **Rule of thumb** - A useful principle having wide application but not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable in every situation.
>
> 宇宙是抽屉柜，实物必须存在于某个抽屉中！

- 五斗橱：事物**必须**存在某一个抽屉中

- eg

### 名词的五斗橱

名词
1. 可数名词

- 单数
  - a/an : 第一次出现
  - the ： 后面出现特指

![](_resource/%E7%AC%AC05%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE/%E7%AC%AC5%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE%20%20%E5%85%8B%E6%9C%8D%E5%B1%A1%E6%95%99%E4%B8%8D%E6%94%B9%E7%9A%847%E4%B8%AA%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E8%AF%AF%E5%8C%BA-1596299933104.jpg)



## 名词五斗橱的划分逻辑

![](_resource/%E7%AC%AC05%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE/%E7%AC%AC5%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE%20%20%E5%85%8B%E6%9C%8D%E5%B1%A1%E6%95%99%E4%B8%8D%E6%94%B9%E7%9A%847%E4%B8%AA%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E8%AF%AF%E5%8C%BA-1596299937461.jpg)

- 中英思维模式差异
  - 中文：默认无冠词
  - 英文：即使没有冠词，这都是抽屉之一
- eg.
  > 投资的本质是延迟消费，也就是现在将钱投到别处，以便未来赚回更多钱
  
  - What you're doing when you invest is deferring consumption and laying money out now to get more money back at a later time.
  
  > 事成之后再付清余款
  
  - You pay the rest of the money when you complete



### 可数名词 vs 不可数名词

区分具体实物 vs 抽象范畴

> - ...working up a passing anger
>
>   [^ work up]: to develop or improve sth with some effort
>   [^ passing]: lasting only for a short period of time and then disappearing.
>
>   - 具体实物：当时一瞬间的愤怒
>
> - …in a voice choked with anger
>
>   - 抽象范畴：愤怒的情绪
>
> - I just heard her speaking **on the radio.**
>   
>   - 具体实物：那台收音机
>   
> - He has already become a climbing spokesman **on radio.**
>   
>   - 抽象范畴：无线电广播，类别媒体
>   
> - Haig and Nixon are regularly **on the phone** with each other.
>   
>   - 具体实物：那台电话
>   
> - ...an attempt to reach her at the camp by telephone.
>   
>   - 抽象范畴：电话这种媒介



具体实物 vs 抽象范畴

>- Now he was talking about their businesses."It's wonderful to promote new industries, because they are very promotable.
>
>- What's your business here? **(objective, mission)**
>-  It's none of your business. **(personal concern)** 



以及习惯所决定

> - You can make do with a pair of jeans/glasses/scissors.
> - 4a.The government have decided to raise taxes.
> - 4b.The government has decided...
> - 4c.Barclays have reported..



在具体的语境下，依据具体的含义去理解名词单复数

> - had nothing of **value** to say
> - sought material values instead of human **values**
> - 比如
> - Buffett thought about the total **value** of the chips.
> - 7.none of the **seats** **was** in the right place.
> - But: None of the consultants **agree** on the same option.
> - None of the **seats** **were** in the right place.



### 不可数名词：the/无冠词（无冠词并非默认通用做法，而是特殊情况）

![](_resource/%E7%AC%AC05%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE/%E7%AC%AC5%E8%AF%BE%20%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E9%A1%BD%E7%96%BE%20%20%E5%85%8B%E6%9C%8D%E5%B1%A1%E6%95%99%E4%B8%8D%E6%94%B9%E7%9A%847%E4%B8%AA%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%E8%AF%AF%E5%8C%BA-1596299943006.jpg)







#### 1. 范畴界标：区别于其他范畴，指明相对位置

此类名词前面没有 `the`

1. 大洲：
   1. Europe, Ameriac, Afica, Asia, Antarctica
   2. As a result Africa was full of refugees

2. 国家
   
1. some of the allies, notably France and Canada
   
3. 街名

   2. **Coffee and tea** are not good drinks for children.(类别标记)



注意: 地名并非一概不加 **the**

eg.

> the United States, the USA, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China.

- 在意义上有特定的指代对象

> the Netherlands, the Philippines 等

- 复数专有名词



#### 2. 抽象事物本身，但是无形体，如情感、品质等形容词或一些动词的名词形式

> Meanwhile, the journalists chased after the Internet moguls as they moved between the Inn and their condos, amplifying the atmosphereof inflated **self-importance** that permeated Sun Valley this year.



> That was so even though Herbert Allen himself thought the"new paradigm"for valuing technology and media stocks-based on clicks and eyeballs and projections of far-off **growth** rather than a company's ability to earn cold hard cash-was bunk.



#### 3. 具体使用中，意识不到单复数背后的抽象类别 or 具体实物结构

> Apart from establishing the national energy strategy, we need to lay out the prospect of the **regional energies** and set a region-shared oil reserve plan. Secondly, we are supposed to cooperate in energy technology **researches and applications.**

- all wrong - 类别标记：

> There' re more than 1.5 millon people in our country currently dying of **cancer** every year.

- 类别标记：相对于其他疾病



#### 4. 类别标记而非具体实物

> Bad news also **includes** an apparent rise of general cancer morbidity rate and death rate in China, in which the rise of **females** has surpass that of **males**.

- [x] includes - Bad news used with a sing. verb
- [ ] female/male 类别标记：女性相对于男性



### 注意复数形式的特定含义

| eg.  | 单数                                      | 复数                                |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|      | the industry - 工业，工业制造；勤劳，勤奋 | the industries - 行业               |
|      | business - 商业，生意，买卖               | businesses - 企业，公司，商店，工厂 |
|      | good                                      | goods                               |
|      | sale - 销售                               | sales - 销售额                      |
|      | economy - 经济...                         | economies - 经济体                  |
|      | internet                                  | the Internet                        |



### 复数形式成为专有名词

> The **sales** of the Fortune five hundred companies grew more than fivefold.



> Some Internet stocks traded at infinite multiples of their nonexistent earnings，while"real companies"that made real things had declined in value.

通常以复数形式出现，如Earnings per share；price per earnings



### 除非特殊情况（抽象类别标记 or 具体某个），一般为复数形式以复数形式出现

特殊情况：抽象类别 或者一个东西：第一次`a/an`, 第二次`the`

一般而言：单词都是以复数形式出现

- **Interest rates** - the cost of borrowing - Buffett explained, are the price of "when."

  [^Interest rates]: the percentage that an institution such as a bank charges or pays you in interest when you borrow money from it or keep money in an account

- The **folks** who ran technology **companies** saw **themselves** as Promethean **geniuses** bringing fire to lesser **mortals**.

  

- They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As **interest rates** vary, the value of all financial assets-houses, stocks, bonds-changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated.

  

- **Profits** had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low.

  

- Fewer people wanted cash-the bird in the hand-at such **low rates.**

  

- **So investors** were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush.

  

- They were perched atop **portfolios** that were jam-packed with stocks trading at extravagant **valuations**.

  

- One was if interest rates fell and remained below **historic levels.**



## 二分法2

### 是否有独立形状？物质名词还是独立个体？（二分法2）

1. 物质名词（mass nouns) :  需要加量词修饰

- water, bread, salt，sand, hair

eg.

- gravel：物质名词
- pebbles ：独立个体，可数名词

eg.

> a smell of fresh **bread**.
>
> Make sure **the bread** is quite cool.
>
> a loaf of bread
>
> a pinch of salt
>
> a glass of milk
>
> a bit/item/piece of news



## Conclusion

- 名词形式无法仅仅依靠死记硬背语法规则来解决

- 名词的限定词取决于语义和习惯，只能不断观察总结结合语法点去理解

- 具体实物 vs 抽象范畴
  - 中英文的根本思维差异
  - 留下积累下不同名词形式代表的不同所指
  
- 不断审视自己的输出中，有没有不明确的名词形式。
